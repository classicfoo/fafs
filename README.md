## Autostart Setup (Recommended)

To make the search tool automatically start when Windows boots:

1. Press `Windows + R` to open Run dialog
2. Type `shell:startup` and press Enter
3. Create a shortcut to `search.pyw` in this startup folder:
   - Right-click in the startup folder
   - Select "New" â†’ "Shortcut"
   - Browse to your `search.pyw` file location
   - Name the shortcut (e.g., "File Search")

Alternatively, you can create a shortcut by:
1. Right-click on `search.pyw`
2. Select "Create shortcut"
3. Cut and paste the shortcut into `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

This ensures the search tool is always readily available when you need it.
